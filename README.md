The problem that first responders have when responding to mass casualty events, and other emergencies, is being able to discern quickly whether their devices are connected 
securely to a network and whether that connection is safe to transmit sensitive information.

 Our simple dashboard  houses all the pertinent information in such a way that allows the first responders to make informed decisions in critical situations.
